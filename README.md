# voice-listener

You'll need these parts:
* A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
* A [Matrix Creator board](https://www.matrix.one/products/creator) - (a [Voice](https://www.matrix.one/products/voice) will probably work, but I haven't tested it)
* A 3D printed [case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2872527)
* Some [speaker mesh cloth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HMBKNSS/) to make the top look a little bit more finished

You'll also need:
* [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) to process all the incoming commands
* And a [Google Speech-to-text API key](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/quickstart) (you can use other providers, but I use Google)
